# Yesplan

## Load

load.php will perform a require_once for all necessary files in the lib-folder.

## Create a client object

This step is crutial all the other functions to work.

    $client = new Yesplan\Client(YESPLAN_DOMAIN, YESPLAN_API_KEY);

Where YESPLAN_DOMAIN should be your Yespan domain, without *http://* and trailing *.yesplan.be*. If your domain is http://rockit.yesplan.be, **rockit** should be your domain.

YESPLAN API key should be a valid key, generated by your Yesplan install.

## Endpoints

For getting data we're using the same method for all edpoints. Note: not all available endpoints in the Yesplan API are yet available in this repository. If you'd like to use an endpoint which is nog included, you can use the Url endpoint.

### Url

    $data = Yesplan\Endpoints\Url::get($client, $full_request_url_without_api_key);

### Events 

#### getList

This function will give a list of events for a given [Yesplan search query](https://manual.yesplan.be/en/query-language/).

    $data = Yesplan\Endpoints\Data::getList($client, $searchquery);

#### get

Get all data from an event.

    $data = Yesplan\Endpoints\Data::get($client, $id);
