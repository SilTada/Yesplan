# Yesplan

## Load

load.php will perform a require_once for all necessary files in the lib-folder.

## Create a client object

    $client = new Yesplan\Client(YESPLAN_DOMAIN, YESPLAN_API_KEY);

Where YESPLAN_DOMAIN should be your Yespan domain, without http:// and trailing .yesplan.be. If your domain is http://rockit.yesplan.be, **rockit** should be your domain.

YESPLAN API key should be a valid key, generated by your Yesplan install.

## Endpoints

For getting data we're using the same method for all edpoints. Note: not all available endpoints in the Yesplan API are yet available in this repository. If you'd like to use an endpoint which is nog included, you can use the Url endpoint.

### Url

    $data = Yesplan\Endpoints\Url::get($client, $full_request_url_without_api_key);

### Events 

#### getList

    $data = Yesplan\Endpoints\Data::getList($client, $searchquery);
